## üí¨ Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> No content model prompt provided - app built as a standalone MERN stack application with MongoDB

### Code Generation Prompt

> To generate the complete source code for a robust, multi-level English quiz application featuring a sophisticated hybrid input system: questions are spoken (TTS) and displayed visually (text + image + MCQ options), and users answer by speaking (STT). It includes full user management, progress tracking, and a professional admin dashboard. This is a full-stack, production-ready application. The backend (Node.js/Express/MongoDB) provides a comprehensive REST API for user, content, and progress management. The student-facing frontend (React.js) integrates Text-to-Speech for questions, displays image-based Multiple Choice Questions, and uses Speech-to-Text with fuzzy matching to process spoken answers. The admin dashboard is a feature-rich SPA for full platform control and analytics.

The app has been tailored to work with MongoDB and includes all the features requested above.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js** & **Express.js** - Server framework
- **MongoDB** & **Mongoose** - Database and ODM
- **JWT** - Authentication and authorization
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing

### Frontend
- **React.js** (Vite) - UI framework
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **Web Speech API** - TTS and STT
- **string-similarity** - Fuzzy matching for voice answers
- **Axios** - HTTP client

## üìã Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
- Modern web browser with Web Speech API support (Chrome recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (after clicking the Clone button above)

2. **Set up the Backend**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/english-quiz-app
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
PORT=5000
```

For MongoDB Atlas, use your connection string:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/english-quiz-app?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

4. **Seed the Database**

```bash
# From the backend directory
node seeder.js
```

This creates:
- Admin user (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`)
- 5 levels with 5 questions each
- Sample progress data

5. **Start the Backend Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`

6. **Set up the Frontend**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

7. **Start the Frontend Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`
